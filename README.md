## Introduction

This project is designed to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to classify tweets into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, and model building using an LSTM network.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be a CSV file named `Twitter_Data.csv` containing tweets with their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-miniproject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nlp-miniproject
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook NLP_Miniproject.ipynb
   ```

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and display the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean text data by removing symbols, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation and stopwords.
- **Text Analysis**: Calculate the length of each tweet.
- **Text Tokenization**: Convert text data into sequences and perform one-hot encoding.
- **Padding**: Apply padding to sequences to ensure uniform input length.
- **Model Building**: Build and compile an LSTM model using TensorFlow.
- **Model Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed data.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed workflow for processing Twitter data and training an LSTM model for sentiment analysis. The results section includes model evaluation metrics and visualizations.
